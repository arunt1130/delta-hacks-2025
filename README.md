Wildfire Detection and Alert System 
This project leverages NASA's API to detect wildfires near a user's location and assess the danger level based on proximity and severity. The goal is to provide a reliable tool to alert individuals of potential wildfire threats, helping them take timely precautions to ensure safety.

Key Features 
Real-Time Data: Integration with NASA's API to fetch up-to-date wildfire information.
Location-Based Alerts: Uses user-provided or device-based geolocation to identify wildfires nearby.
Danger Level Assessment: Calculates the risk level based on the distance and intensity of detected wildfires.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear and concise alerts to make the information accessible to all users.
Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
Backend: Django (Handles API interactions, data processing, and logic)
Frontend: React.js
External APIs: NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) API
